# Tutorial LLM

This tutorial will guide you through the process of training a large language model (LLM) step
by step. For educational purposes, we choosed a small dataset and a small model, but the basic principles we want to convey is the same with larger models.

There are 2 ways for you to learn:

- Run the notebook in Google Colab. With Google Colab, everyone can train an LLM from scratch with just a browser. To be done.
- Run the `run.py` script on your local machine. All code is well-documented and easy to understand.

Note that a free GPU like T4 in Google Colab is enough for the default setting. If you want to
run it with only CPU, you may need to reduce training iterations to avoid long waiting time.
But meanwhile, you cannot observe the expected effect of the training process.
